# Changelog

All notable changes to Walnut will be documented here. Format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Walnut 8] - in progress

### Added
### Fixed
- Fix `inf` and `test` performance [#33](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/33)

### Changed
- Build process now uses Maven, thanks to [Markus Frohme](https://github.com/mtf90)
- Morphism command now allows symbols outside of the range of 0-9 (for both domain and range) [#43](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/43)
- Switch to standard logging framework [#23](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/23)

## [Walnut 7.1] - 2025-12-02 - Author: John Nicol

### Added

- Added --global-session arg, to support old (Walnut 6 and earlier) global session behavior.
- Added Mathematica (.wl), Matlab/Octave (.m), and Sage (.sage) outputs for matrices [#35](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/35)
 
### Fixed

- Fixed regression [#38 (load commands running twice)](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/38)
- Fixed regression : `test` command not outputting all accepted strings
- Fixed regression : free-variable validation became too strict
- Fix old bug: `reg` command could result in corrupted regex in very rare case
- Fix old bug: silent integer overflows
- Fix old bug: NFA inputs led to unexpected behavior; also, NFAO (undefined) was allowed

### Changed

- Only determinize when not already deterministic. Also, other small space-saving improvements.
- Removed >65K alphabet size limitation [#39](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/39)
- Upgraded OTF to version 1.1.0. Several performance fixes, sometimes 10x faster; for larger NFAs, sometimes 10x less memory. [OTF changelog](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- Corrected and reorganized help and usage messages

## [Walnut 7.0] - 2025-08-01 - Author: John Nicol

- Source: [https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut]

### Added

- Versioning output to Walnut.
- Session functionality. Each run of Walnut writes to a new session, making it easier to organize and not overwrite previous results.
- Ability to specify session and home directories from command line.
- Walnut .txt files and scripts now allow comments.
- Dead states are removed (trim) before determinization.
- Leverage the [AutomataLib](https://github.com/LearnLib/automatalib) library.
- Leverage the [OTF](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF) library.
- Allow writing NFAs to the [BA](https://languageinclusion.org/doku.php?id=tools) format, including intermediate automata.
- Determinization strategy choices:
  * [Brzozowski's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization#Brzozowski's_algorithm)
  * [OTF-CCL](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF) and [OTF-CCLS](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF)
  * [Brzozowski-OTF-CCL](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF) and [Brzozowski-OTF-CCLS](https://github.com/jn1z/OTF)
- Metacommands: "strategy" (see above) and "export", which allows exporting intermediate automata.
- Command "describe" describes an automaton.

### Fixed

- Major performance improvements, particularly in product automata construction, Walnut file I/O, and the `test` command.
- Fixed OOM error when writing large Graphviz files (reported by Pierre Ganty).
- Fixed [`reg` bug](https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/issues/37) (reported by Luke Schaeffer).
- Removed unnecessary determinizations when handling leading/trailing zeros.
- Drastically increased code re-use, testing, and code coverage.
- Fixed unexpected behavior for Word Automata when all outputs > 0.
- Fixed unexpected behavior for integer rounding when doing division with negative numbers (fixed by Jonathan Yang).
        
### Changed

- "eval" and "def" commands are now the same. Before, "eval" didn't write files to "Automata Library", which was confusing.
- "draw" command (which wrote automata to .gv files) is replaced with the more generic "export" command (which can currently write to .ba, .gv, or .txt files).
- Help documentation organized into topics.

### Removed

- JVM backwards compatibility. Walnut now requires JDK 17 or higher.
